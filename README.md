# üáµüá∞ Pakistani\_Celebrities\_Gender\_And\_Name\_Classification

This project focuses on detecting, classifying, and identifying Pakistani celebrities by leveraging deep learning techniques. It uses YOLOv8 for **face detection and gender classification**, and Keras ResNet50 for **name (identity) recognition** based on cropped facial features.

---

## üîç Project Overview

* **YOLOv8m** is trained for:

  * Detecting **faces** of Pakistani celebrities in images/videos.
  * Classifying detected faces by **gender** (male/female).
* **Keras ResNet50** is trained on:

  * The **cropped face images** extracted via YOLO.
  * Recognizing and classifying the **name (identity)** of the celebrity.

---

## üìÅ Dataset Structure

The dataset should consists of:

* **15 known any Pakistani celebrities** with 180 images each.
* An additional **"others" class (-1)** with >540 images for unknown faces.
* Each image is labeled by **gender** and **name ID**.

```
/dataset
    /train
        /0 (celebrity ID)
        /1
        ...
        /14
        /-1 (others)
```

## üß† Models Used

### 1. **YOLOv8m**

* Used for **face detection** and **gender classification**.
* Trained on labeled images with bounding boxes and gender annotations.

### 2. **Keras ResNet50**

* Fine-tuned on YOLO-cropped face images.
* Used for **name classification** of known celebrities.

## üß™ Pipeline

1. **Face Detection + Gender Classification**
   ‚Üí Using YOLOv8m to detect faces and classify gender.

2. **Face Cropping**
   ‚Üí Detected faces are cropped and passed to the next stage.

3. **Name Classification**
   ‚Üí Cropped face is fed to ResNet50 model to predict celebrity identity.
